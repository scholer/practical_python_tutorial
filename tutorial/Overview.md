Example showcases:

Part 0: Getting started
* Installing Python and configuring your environment with `conda`.
* Writing and executing Python code: `python` files and the REPL, `ipython`, and Jupyter notebooks.
* Packaging, installing and executing your modules and functions - `setup.py` and `pip`.


Part 1: The basics
* Basics I: Standard data structures, reading and writing files, manipulating strings, defining functions, etc.
    Examples: Find reversed complement to DNA sequence, calculate protein charge, reading/writing csv data.
* Basics II: Manipulating cadnano files (optional, specialized).
* Basics III: Making a command-line program - `argparse`, `click`. Examples: Convert above (and below) to command line tools.

Part 2: Practical examples
* Downloading files from the web - `requests`, `re` (regular expressions). Use cases: NEB, IDT, Mediawiki.
* Re-sizing images in a PowerPoint presentation - `zipfile`, `PIL`, `tempfile`, `os`.
* Basic data analysis and visualization - `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`.
* Jupyter Notebooks - `notebook`.
* Image analysis and processing - `PIL`, `skimage`.
* Interacting with other command line programs - `subprocess`.
* Reading and writing Excel files.
* Interacting with official and unofficial web-APIs: Open/public APIs, Wikipedia, NuPack. Background: REST, GraphQL.
* Running a web-server.

Part 3: Beyond the basics - Features used by professional Python programmers
* Object-oriented programming: Using `class`es to combine data/state and functions/methods into objects.
* Testing your code with `pytest`.
* Sharing and distributing your code and packages I: Git.
* Sharing and distributing your code and packages II: Python Packaging Index (PyPI) and the `pip` package manager.
* Sharing and distributing your code and packages III: Conda and Anaconda. (Optional, specialized)
* Performance critical code: Numba, Cython, pypy.
